Hello everyone

- Coroutine should be separated in small functions (each function can only contain one loop) (More readable)

- Events should be written like: On + Object + V(ing/ed). Ex: OnAgentSpawned
- Folder structures: 
    - Data folder: contains ScriptableObject components and types

- Task Designer
    - The step should be split only one time. After that, the children of that step will no longer be separated again.
